load-forecasting
================

A framework for load forecasting, where seasonal cycles are removed from the input signal. A genetic algorithm is used to parameterize various forecasting models.

Note: accessing the data files does not work currently - there is one dataset we cannot publish. This will be resolved shortly, and we will make the others available. However, all the other source code
is available, and it should be (relatively) straightforward to use the system with another dataset.
