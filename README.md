load-forecasting
================

A framework for load forecasting, where seasonal cycles are removed from the input signal. A genetic algorithm is used to parameterize various forecasting models.

Note: accessing the data files does not work currently - we are investigating whether we can publish our datasets. This will be resolved shortly. However, all the other source code
is available, and it should be (relatively) straightforward to use the system with another dataset.
